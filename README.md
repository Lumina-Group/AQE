# AQE: Anti-Quantum Encryption
[Êó•Êú¨Ë™û](/README_JA.md)
**AQE** is a next-generation quantum-resistant encryption library designed for the post-quantum era. While conventional cryptographic libraries face the risk of being broken by quantum computers, AQE provides practical protection that is available right now.

## üõ°Ô∏è Quantum-Ready Protection

```python
# Generate quantum-resistant encryption in just a few lines
kex = QuantumSafeKEX()
transport = SecureTransport(await kex.exchange(peer_awa)[0])
encrypted = await transport.encrypt(your_data)
```
